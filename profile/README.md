## Is Teachable Worth Paying For?

In my opinion—and based on using it for a few projects—it’s definitely worth it if you’re serious about online courses.

Here’s why:  
- **User-Friendly:** You don’t need to be tech-savvy. The platform guides you through setup, and it’s pretty intuitive.  
- **All-in-One Tools:** You get marketing, sales, payment processing, and even tax help built right in.  
- **Customizable:** Whether it's the course layout or student experience, you can tailor things to match your brand.

If there’s a downside, it’s probably the transaction fees on the lower plans—but that’s manageable if you plan to upgrade as you grow.
